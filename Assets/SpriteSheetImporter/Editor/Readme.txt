# Flash Sprite Sheet Importer #

This tool allows you to import Sprite Sheet Information Generated by Adobe Animate (Flash).

In Adobe Animate, you can export sprite sheets packed with an XML file which describes the location of sprites.

Update: Using Starling XML format now adds the possibility to use the original MovieClip pivot.

With this extension it can easily slice the sprite sheet for you with the XML file.

Get importer window by opening:
Window -> Sprite Sheet Importer

Then select a 2D Texture sprite sheet (along side accompanying XML file).

Then press 'Import Sprites'.
